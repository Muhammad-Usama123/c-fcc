// Introduction to character manipulation and strings:

    // message 'a' 'b' 'c'... // character array, not in C++ syntax, just to show the array in this line in human language maybe...

    // C-string's few built in facilities:

        // length
        // concatenate
        // copy
        // Search

    // C-strings are not safe or convenient to work with in C plus plus and C plus plus provide another type that really built on top of 'character arrays' which is "std::string" maybe, and it gives us an easier interface to work with and we can just focus on storing in the data and doing stuff with it in  our C++ programs...
