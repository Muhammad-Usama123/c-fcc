// # include <iostream>

// C++ Core Language:

    // In which we follow basic c++ rules like how variables should declare, how a function should define etc. etc.

// Standard Library:

    //  Set of ready to use highly specialized components that we can easily use in our c++ programs. #include <iostream>, #include <string> etc. are standard library features. c++ standard library tries to provide highly specialized components that we can use in regular c++ programs.

// STL:

    // Advanced version of standard library feature maybe. Containers etc. we will learn about it in this course.
