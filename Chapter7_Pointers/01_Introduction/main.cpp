    // very important topic in C++ and allows us to do some of the things very conveniently and we're going to be learning about all those tricky things you can do with them... 

    // variables have an address in memory... address in memory means at which byte that variable is stored in our computer's memory that byte address will be the address of our that variable that is stored at this memory location maybe... and we can grab that address and store that in special kind of variable that is used to store pointers and that variable is called a pointer...

    // A pointer is a special kind of variable that stores the addresses of other variables... pointer to char, pointer to double etc. even pointers to custom types is possible...
