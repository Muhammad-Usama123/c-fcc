// # include <iostream>

// int main(){
//     std::cout << "abc world!" << std::endl;
// }

// Errors:

    // We will see errors in problems tab(we can see it after opening the terminal) and in terminal which we can see by opening a terminal.

    // 3 kinds of errors:

        // 1) Compile Time Errors // errors that we receive during the compilation of our c++ code and compilation doesn't succeed due to that error.

        // 2) Runtime Errors // it's a logical error in your compiled program like we wanted to print green on some user interface, but our binary executable .exe file prints gray instead of green, so to get rid of this we have to fix the mistake in our program. Runtime errors can also cause our program to fail and terminate immidiately means the program can crash.

        // 3) Warnings // This is a problem that is not serious enough for the compiler to halt our compilation, our compilation is going to succeed but this is the problem that our compiler will tell us that some things in our code has some problems so we should really fix these problems before they become a serious problem.
