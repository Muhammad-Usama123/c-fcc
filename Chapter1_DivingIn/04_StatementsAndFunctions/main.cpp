// Statements:

    // basic unit of computation in a c++ program.

    // Every c++ program is a collection of statements organized in a certain way to achieve some goal.

    // Statements end with a semicolon (;) in c++.

    // Statements execute in order from top to bottom.

    // Execution keeps going until there is a statement causing the program to terminate, or start running another sequence of statements(like statements in a function maybe).

// Variables are a way to store data in our program.

// Functions:

    // A function must be declared(function prototype maybe) or defined before it's use.

    // Function Prototype definition in c++ is maybe not necessary.

// int first_number {7}; // we can also declare variables and store their values in curly braces like this.
