// # include <iostream>

// int main(){
//     auto result = (10 <=> 20) > 0; // "<=>" is called spaceship operator for testing compiler supports our given C++ (in this case c++ 20) version or not.
//     std::cout << result << std::endl;
// }

// Understanding The Above Code:

    // # include <iostream>:

        // This is a feature c++ offers to load the pre built libraries that we can use. "<iostream>" is specifically going to help us print. "std::cout << "abc world!" << std::endl;" we have this statement because we have included "<iostream>" like in the example below:

            // # include <iostream>

            // int main(){
            //     std::cout << "abc world!" << std::endl;
            //     return 0;
            // } // This main function is important because it is the starting point of c++ program. The main function is also called the entry point of the c++ program.

            //"std::endl" is for printing the new line.

            // Statements in the main function run in order from top to bottom and the program is going to end when the statements inside the main function reach the closing curly bracket of this main function. Return statement is also a way to end this main function and normally we will see in main function "return 0" and this return 0 is for sending the message to the operating system that whether the program ran successfully or if there was some kind of problem.
